This repository contains the source code for a weather app that displays the current weather and 3-day forecast for selected or current location. The app is built using .NET MAUI, a cross-platform UI framework for building native apps for iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and more.

## Installation
To install and run the app, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/edinSahbaz/maui-weather.git
```
2. Install the .NET MAUI SDK. You can follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation).
3. Open the .sln solution file in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
4. Run the app using the desired platform-specific tooling, such as Visual Studio's iOS or Android simulator.

## Usage
When the app is started, it will display the current weather conditions for your current location, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather (e.g. "Clear", "Cloudy", "Rainy"). 

The app also includes a 3-day forecast, which can be accessed below the current weather data on the main screen, and the favorites page that allows users to set up to 8 favorite locations for quick access.
